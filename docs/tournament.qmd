title: Tournament Evaluations
---

## Overview

Tournament evaluations rank models from pairwise judgments with incremental TrueSkill updates. The workflow separates:

1. Generation of contestant outputs for prompts
2. Pairwise judging of scheduled matches
3. Rating and convergence checks

Tournament state is stored in a portable directory (`state_dir`) backed by SQLite plus normal Inspect eval logs.

## Config

Tournament runs are configured with a YAML file. Core fields:

- `completion_log_dir`: generation log output
- `log_dir`: judge and export logs
- `state_dir`: persistent tournament DB location (defaults to `<log_dir>/state`)
- `contestant_models`: initial model pool
- `prompts`: prompt list
- `rating_params`: TrueSkill parameters
- `batch_size`, `max_total_matches`, `p_stop`, `epsilon`: scheduling/stop controls
- `judge_model`, `judge_prompt_template`: judge setup

Example: `creative_writing_tournament.yaml`

## CLI Workflow

Initialize state:

```bash
inspect tournament init tournament.yaml
```

Generate contestant outputs:

```bash
inspect tournament generate tournament.yaml
```

Run tournament loop:

```bash
inspect tournament run tournament.yaml
```

Inspect status and export rankings:

```bash
inspect tournament status logs/tournament/creative_writing/state
inspect tournament export logs/tournament/creative_writing/state
```

## Add Models After Initial Run

Add one or more models without restarting from scratch:

```bash
inspect tournament add-model logs/tournament/creative_writing/state \
  --model hf/google/gemma-3-12b-it \
  --model hf/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
```

`add-model` updates persisted tournament config, initializes ratings for new models, generates/indexes missing responses, and resumes scheduling/judging.

## Python API

```python
from inspect_ai.tournament import (
    run_tournament,
    resume_tournament,
    add_models,
    tournament_status,
    export_rankings,
)

run_tournament("tournament.yaml")
add_models("logs/tournament/creative_writing/state", models=["hf/google/gemma-3-12b-it"])
status = tournament_status("logs/tournament/creative_writing/state")
export_rankings("logs/tournament/creative_writing/state")
```
